We propose a formalization of an universal property of the pure,
untyped, Lambda Calculus (modulo alpha-beta-eta equivalence) as
exposed in the paper

  http://math.unice.fr/~maggesi/lam.pdf

In short, the main theorems (EXP_OPERAD_MOR_LC_EXP_MAP,
LC_EXP_MAP_UNIQUE in file lc_univ.ml) reads as follows:

  "Lambda calculus is the initial object of the category of
   exponential operads."

We also have a formalization of the same theorem in Coq which is
available from

  http://math.unice.fr/~maggesi/lc-2005-12-20.tar.gz  .
